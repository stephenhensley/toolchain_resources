# toolchain_resources
Home to my config files and what not for my toolchain.

Contents:
tmux.conf - Configuration file for tmux - terminal multiplexor.
bashrc - my linux bashrc file
vimrc - my vimrc configuration file.

There's nothing really special here. But I'd rather have them online somewhere so I can have access to them for reinstalls, etc.
